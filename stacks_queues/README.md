# Stack & Queue Patterns

Stacks and queues are fundamental linear data structures used for a variety of algorithmic problems involving **LIFO (last-in-first-out)** and **FIFO (first-in-first-out)** behaviors.

---

## ðŸ§  When to Use

- Stacks: Parsing, undo/redo, next greater element, recursion simulation
- Queues: Time-window problems, BFS, producer-consumer models

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Techniques

- **Monotonic Stack:** Maintains elements in increasing or decreasing order to track next greater/smaller values
- **Two-Stack Queue:** Simulate FIFO behavior using LIFO stacks
- **Sliding Window Queue:** Queue with a rolling time constraint
