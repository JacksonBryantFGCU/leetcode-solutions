# Topological Sort & Course Scheduling

Topological sort is used to order the nodes of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that every edge `u â†’ v` places `u` before `v`. It's also used to detect cycles.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- DFS with state tracking (unvisited, visiting, visited)
- Use visited array or color map for cycle detection
- Post-order DFS = topological order
