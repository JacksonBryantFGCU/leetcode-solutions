# BFS â€“ Shortest Path & Grid Expansion

These problems use breadth-first traversal to find minimal distances or fill values from a source or set of sources.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- BFS ensures shortest path when all edge weights = 1
- Track visited cells to avoid loops
- Queue stores current position (and distance if needed)
