# Graph Traversal Patterns (DFS & BFS)

This section contains problems involving traversal of graphs and grids using depth-first or breadth-first search.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- DFS: Recursive exploration of connected components
- BFS: Level-order or shortest-path traversal using a queue
- Grid-as-Graph: Treat 2D grids like undirected graphs
- Clone graphs: Track visited nodes to avoid infinite cycles
