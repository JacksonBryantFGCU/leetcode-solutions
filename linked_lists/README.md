# Linked List Patterns

Linked lists are pointer-based structures used to model dynamic memory, sequencing, and ordered operations. They're commonly tested in interviews for in-place updates, fast/slow pointer logic, and recursive behavior.

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Use dummy nodes to simplify edge cases (head insertion/removal)
- Use `prev`, `curr`, `next` pointers for safe traversal
- Use slow/fast pointers for cycle detection or midpoint finding
