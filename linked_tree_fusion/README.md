# Linked List â†” Binary Tree Fusion

These problems require recursively or iteratively connecting two data structures â€” often requiring careful pointer, recursion, or traversal logic.

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Two-pointer middle finder for list â†’ BST
- Post-order pointer reattachment for flattening
- Recursively check downward paths to validate list match
