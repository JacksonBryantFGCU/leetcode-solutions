# Dynamic Programming â€“ String and 2D Table

These problems use 1D or 2D DP to process strings or match/edit substrings.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- 1D bottom-up DP (e.g. decoding, Fibonacci-like)
- 2D table for edit distance or overlapping substrings
- Palindrome checking with backtracking for partitioning
