# Advanced Sliding Window

These problems extend basic sliding window logic to deal with:
- Dynamic length ranges
- Frequency constraints
- Monotonic queues

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Subtract/add to maintain running totals
- Use `Map` to track distinct character counts
- Use `Deque` for tracking sliding max/min efficiently
