# Day 39: Mock Interview Simulation

## Format
Live Coding – Valid Parentheses + Word Ladder

## Time Used
Start:  
End:  
Total: __ minutes

## Notes

### Valid Parentheses
- ✅ Explained stack usage and mapping
- 🧠 Used examples like "()" and "(]"
- ⚠️ Missed an edge case on empty string initially

### Word Ladder
- ✅ BFS logic was solid
- ✅ Pruned used words with `Set.delete`
- ⚠️ Had to think through when to return `length + 1`

## Improvements
- Speak time complexity aloud (O(n² * k) for Word Ladder)
- Practice more BFS-based word graph problems
