# Binary Search Patterns

Binary search is used to find target values or boundaries in sorted arrays or problems with a monotonic property. These variations use mid-point checks to drive search direction.

## ðŸ§  Core Variants

- Standard binary search: `O(log n)` search in sorted arrays
- Rotated search: Handle two sorted halves
- Peak search: Binary search based on relative comparisons
