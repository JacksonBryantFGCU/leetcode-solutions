# Heap / Priority Queue Patterns

These problems use a heap (min or max) to efficiently maintain top or bottom values in a dataset.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Min-heap to keep K largest/smallest
- Max-heap for greedy simulation
- Frequency map + sort for quick top-K (less optimal but readable)
