# Dynamic Programming â€“ Intermediate Level

These problems go beyond base-case logic. They typically involve:
- Multiple state transitions
- Slicing or nested iteration
- String segmentation or array-based optimization

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Use arrays to store sub-solutions
- Break down problems into prefix/suffix comparisons
- Watch for overlapping subproblems and reuse solutions
