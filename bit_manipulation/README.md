# Bit Manipulation Patterns

Bit manipulation is a powerful low-level tool used in XOR-based counting, binary optimization, and bit masking.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- XOR for finding unique elements or toggling states
- Bit masking for setting/clearing/checking bits
- Shift operations (`<<`, `>>`, `>>>`) to move across bits
- Use `n & (n - 1)` to remove the lowest set bit
