### STAR: Leadership / Teaching – Math Tutoring at FGCU

**Situation:**  
I work as a math tutor at FGCU, where I help students in Calculus I–III and over 10 other STEM courses.

**Task:**  
I often lead 1:1 or small group sessions and adjust explanations to match different learning styles — especially during exam weeks.

**Action:**  
For students struggling in Calc II, I’ve broken down integral techniques visually, walked them through substitution problems step-by-step, and created customized practice problems to reinforce weak areas. I try to make complex concepts feel approachable and repeatable.

**Result:**  
Many students I work with improve exam performance or return consistently for help. Beyond the math, it’s taught me how to explain technical concepts clearly — a skill that translates directly into software teamwork, documentation, and pair programming.
