### STAR: Teamwork – Arthrex Hackathon Project

**Situation:**  
I participated in a 36-hour hackathon where my team and I built “Arthrex MySurgery” — a web portal for patients to communicate with their surgeon and track pre/post-op checklists.

**Task:**  
I was responsible for the frontend experience. Our goal was to have a working MVP with clean UI and smooth navigation across multiple views, even without a backend.

**Action:**  
I built the UI using React and React Router, implemented a temporary login system to simulate authentication, and designed the dashboard components to show surgeon info and checklist items. I coordinated closely with teammates who handled backend planning and pitch content.

**Result:**  
We delivered a complete demo, walked judges through our architecture, and clearly communicated what backend features we’d build next. It was one of the most collaborative and time-constrained projects I’ve worked on, and taught me how to ship under pressure with teammates I’d just met.
