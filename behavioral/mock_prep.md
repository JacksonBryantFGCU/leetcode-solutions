## ✅ 1-Minute Elevator Pitch

Hi, I’m Jackson Bryant — a Software Engineering student at FGCU and a React-focused front-end developer with full-stack experience.  
I’ve built production-ready projects using React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Node.js, including a portfolio site with dynamic backend content, a surgery portal built in a hackathon, and a community site for a local pickleball club.  
I also tutor over 16 hours a week in Calculus and Discrete Math, which has sharpened my ability to explain technical topics clearly.  
Right now I’m looking for an internship where I can work on real user-facing features, learn from other engineers, and contribute to production code.
