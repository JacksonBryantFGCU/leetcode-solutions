# Array & Interval Patterns

This section covers problems involving array manipulation, prefix/postfix tricks, and greedy merging of sorted intervals.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Ideas

### Arrays
- Prefix/suffix tracking for efficient element-wise transformation
- In-place updates with constant space

### Intervals
- Sort intervals by start time
- Merge overlapping intervals using greedy scan
- Handle edge cases where intervals fully overlap or sit side-by-side
