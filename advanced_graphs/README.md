# Advanced Graph Patterns

These problems involve non-trivial graph concepts like lexical dependency ordering and low-link articulation points. They test knowledge of DFS internals, topological sort, and Tarjanâ€™s algorithm.

## ðŸ§  Core Techniques

- Build graph from lexical or structural data
- Use indegree maps for Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (Alien Dictionary)
- Use discovery time and low-link values for articulation points (Tarjan)
