# Dynamic Programming (1D)

Dynamic programming is used to solve problems that can be broken down into **overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure**. These 1D problems focus on solving from the bottom-up or memoizing top-down recursive calls.

## ðŸ§  Core Ideas

- Use a DP array or rolling variables to store subproblem solutions
- Bottom-up (tabulation) preferred when recursion depth is large
- Look for choices at each step: rob vs skip, step 1 vs step 2, etc.
